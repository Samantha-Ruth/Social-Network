# Social-Network


## Description
This app utilizes the NOSQL database MongoDB and the ODM Mongoose!  The technologies included are node.js and express. This app lets individuals share thoughts, react to other friends' thoughts, and allows friends to connect with one another, adding up how many friends they have connected with. 

This application introduced me to NOSQL databases and how they are a different resource from relational databases.  I learned how to install MongoDB and Mongoose, how to initiate the Mongo shell, how to create collections, fields, and documents that interelate to one another using subdocuments and nested arrays.

## Installation
This application uses MongoDB, Mongoose, and Express.  Download the app and then run npm init and npm i to install the dependencies. 

## Usage
A backend databse for an up and coming social network!
